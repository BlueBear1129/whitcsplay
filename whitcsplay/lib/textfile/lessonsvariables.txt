Variable Concept 
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Data Types 
* int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
* double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
* char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
* string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
* bool - stores values with two states: true or false


Example : 

int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
