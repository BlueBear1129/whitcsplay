What is C++ ? 


C++ is a general-purpose , object-oriented programming language.

C++ is executed from the main function.

Writing a program involves designing a strategy for solving a problem and then using a programming language to implement that strategy. 

Your first code

#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;

Int main()
{ 
      // Display Hello  World to the  C++ console 

       cout<< “Hello World” <<endl;

       return 0;
}
