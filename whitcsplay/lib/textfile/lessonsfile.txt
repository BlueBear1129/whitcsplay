Introduction to Programming  C++ ( Text Book)

What is a Computer ? 
A computer includes hardware and software.  
The hardware  comprises of the visible, physical elements of the computer. Software provides the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform specific task.

Hardware 
Hardware components help us understand the effects that a program’s instructions have on a computer. 

Major computer hardware:
Central processing Unit (CPU) 
Memory
Storage devices
Input devices ( mouse and keyboard)
Output devices (monitors and printers)
Communication devices  (modems) 

Software 
Computer do not understand human language so programs must be written in languages computers understand. 

Operating Systems :
The operating systems( OS) is the most important program that runs on the computer. The OS manages and controls a computer’s activities. 

Computers have 3 different languages

Machine Learning: inbuilt language of 1101101010011010

Assembly Language : This language uses short descriptive words to represent each of the machine learning instructions. For example add means to add two numbers. 
The assembler is used to translate machine learning code. 

High-Level Language 
High-level language are programming languages designed for a specific purpose and can run on any computer. It needs a compiler to run on computers.
